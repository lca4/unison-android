  <h1>GroupStreamer</h1>
  <p>
    GroupStreamer is a music recommender system for parties and gatherings: it
    picks out the best music on your Android device given the people around you.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a short tutorial on how to use it. Enjoy !
  </p>

  <h2>Basic scenario</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine you are hosting a party. You and hopefully a few of your guests have
    the GroupStreamer app on their phone. One of you will create a <em>group</em>
    for the party, and all of you will join the group. You will then decide on
    one person that is providing the music&mdash;i.e. the <em>DJ</em>. This
    person will plug his phone into loudspeakers and start playing music through
    GroupStreamer.
  </p>

  <p>
    GroupStreamer tries to select the music according to the preferences of
    everyone in the group. People's musical tastes are automatically inferred
    from the contents of their music library.
  </p>

  <h2>The groups list</h2>
  <p>
    This screen shows you the groups that are nearby. Often, you'll first want
    to <em>create</em> a new group. You can then ask your friends / guests to
    <em>join</em> the group you've just created simply by touching its name.
  </p>

  <h2>The music player</h2>
  <p>
    The main screen is the music player. If you want to provide the music for
    the group, you can grab the DJ spot (it's first come, first served).  You'll
    be then presented with a standard media player bar.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are not the DJ, you can still see which song is currently playing.
    You can also give a rating on the current song, which will help
    GroupStreamer make more precise recommendations in the future.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The group suggestions</h2>
  <p>
    GroupStreamer can create groups for you! Make sure you and your friends have made checked the "Enable Suggestions" checkbox in your settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can also happen that suggestions are not working because you have not allowed the app to use your localization. A button should appear above the list of groups to take you to the settings. If that is not the case please go to the settings yourself and enable location services.
  </p>
  
  <h2>NFC in GroupStreamer</h2>
  <p>
    You can make use of NFC to invite your friends to a Group. To do so make sure you have enabled NFC communications (and Android Beam if applicable), join a group a stay in the player's screen. Now simply bump your phone to that of your friend, they will receive an invitation!
  </p>
  
  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  
  <h3>Group suggestions do not work</h3>
  <p>
    Make sure that the "Enable Suggestions" checkbox is enabled for everyone in the app's settings. Make sure everyone is sharing their position with the app. Hit refresh when looking at the list of groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you still do not get a suggestion maybe no other users are near you... If that is not the case one of you will have to manually create a group using the "Create Group" button situated above the groups list.
  </p>
  
  <h3>No illustration for a song</h3>
  <p>
    This could mean that the title and/or the artist of the song were not recognized by the server. This could impair the recommendations made by the app! You can verify that the title and artist are both correct or add tags manually to describe the song.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Bumping phones does not invite my friend to my group</h3>
  <p>
    Not all phones are NFC capable! If both phones are compatible, go to the phones' settings and make sure you have enabled NFC communication (and Android Beam if applicable).
